    "As is well known in social science literature, most people who play the lottery do so for fun and without major problems; however, for some this activity turns into a habit which eventually escalates into addiction. A medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions wants to build a dedicated mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning.\n",

    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
