# lottery-project

As is well known in social science literature, most people who play the lottery do so for fun and without major problems; however, for some this activity turns into a habit which eventually escalates into addiction. A medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions wants to build a dedicated mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning.

The purpose of this project is to assist in the development of this app by answering questions such as:

    What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?
    What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?
    What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?

The data set is historical data from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. The data set has data for 3,665 drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018.
